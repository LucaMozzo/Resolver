Resolver
========

This project is, for now, an attempt to create an open source, WolframAlpha-like web application that allows the user to enter expressions and receive a best guess of the desired result. We are at the very beginning stages of development. 

Beginning with basic well-known computations, we plan to extend its functions to symbolic manipulation, persistent workspaces with variable assignments, and visualization.

If you would like to contribute, contact Luca.
